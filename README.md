# Login-demo
Sample demo on login for authenticated users

## React
* Login page -> home page
* Signup page -> create new account
* landing page -> login page routes here with a button to logout.
* Logut page -> logs the user out of the app.

## Rails
* User API - contains name, email and password as column names in users table.
* Login API - authenticates the user using hashing algorithm (bcrypt is installed)
* Signup API - adds new user into the database (postgresql is used)
* Logout API - loggs out the user from current session generated.

Postman was used to verify the working logic of API's before integrating with React.
